# Image-Restoration-with-ViTs-Pytorch

## Overview
This repository is built for educational purposes on image restoration using various super-resolution models, including Vision Transformers (ViTs). The main goal is to demonstrate how these models can be applied to enhance image quality by restoring high-frequency details lost during downsampling. Much of the novel mechanisms developed are reimplemented on this repository to demonstrate the intuition behind such mechanisms. Weights, results, and visual results will be provided as the repository develops. This repository contains implementations, training scripts, weights,and visual results for different super-resolution models in PyTorch.
